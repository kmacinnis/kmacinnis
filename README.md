 I am a dynamic and creative programming hobbyist, with over 20 years of experience coding to solve my own problems. I'm looking to become part of a team and solve someone else's. (Maybe yours?)

- I am most proficient in Python, but I pick up new languages and frameworks quickly
- My previous experience as a math professor helps me communicate complex \(and potentially confusing\!\) ideas simply and clearly
- I love helping people out! I have a history of running around being helpful on the internet
