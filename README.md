### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a dynamic and creative programming hobbyist, with over 20 years of experience coding to solve my own problems. I'm looking to become part of a team and solve someone else's. (Maybe yours?)

- I am most proficient in Python, but I pick up new languages and frameworks quickly
- My previous experience as a math professor helps me communicate complex (and potentially confusing!) ideas simply and clearly
- (this would look better if it had 3 bullet points)

Resume to be linked.
